# Container Technologies Survey Plan

## Objectives
1. Determine the makeup of the community of people using container technologies for HPC applications (and possibly all scientific applications?)
2. Determine the popularity of different container technologies for HPC applications (and science apps)
3. Assess the opinions about current container technologies for HPC
4. Assess who consumes containers vs. who develops containers vs. who configures container runtimes, registries, and other container technologies
5. Assess the opinions about current OCI specification implementations
6. Collect opinions on requested improvements to the OCI specification for HPC containers 

## Population and Sampling

The entire population of folks using container technologies is much broader than the target population because of the broad use of container technologies
in a wide variety of industries, academia, and government applications.  Ultimately we desire our sample of the larger population of people using
container technologies to reach internationally and contain a diverse group of people.  The _target population_ for this survey is any and all people
who are using container technologies for HPC and/or scientific applications in any setting.  This includes:
* Research Software Engineers (RSEs)
* Sysadmins
* Researchers
* Students
* Software Engineers
* and possibly more

Types of container technologies we are interested in include (but are not limited to):
* Container Runtimes
* Container Registries
* ...

Types of applications of container technologies we are interested in include (but are not limited to):
* Cloud computing for science
* Supercomputing
* Machine Learning applications
* Small local clusters

Target population, or at least average person within target population, may not be aware of OCI.

## Data Analysis Plan




## Survey Design

* We want to keep the survey short!
* Demographics collection
* What/which questions
* Ask questions based on whether they do certain tasks
* Cater questions towards expertise and knowledge



## Testing the Survey



## How we will Conduct the Survey

* Site with branding ready in time for SC, but not try to finish ahead of time
* Target early December?
* Need IRB approval/expemption
* 


## Remaining Questions

* Do we intend to focus on results pertaining to HPC? As in, maybe we collect results from anyone who is willing to fill it out, but we are really concerned with folks using containers for HPC in some way. Said another way: Are we interested in results from folks who have only ever used containers for non-HPC tasks, and thus may have a biased opinion about HPC containers?
